# ECE445
Finsihed Code is the code to run the LED program we displayed in the demo
LocalTest is files I was using to try and emulate what signal would look like locally and test that
its also where I was trying to figure out how to use pyglet to run two monitors on a single python script rather than using the three currently


TestCode is just a random assorment of code that I used to test various things when I was making the code
