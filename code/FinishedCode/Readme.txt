To run the script go into this folder in the terminal and the type sudo ./script
or you can open three terminals and run DeviceLogic.py using sudo python3 and then run 
Monitor1 and Monitor2 after.

I recommend rewriting a lot of the code since I work it with a single pulse in mind

If the program crashes and stop running afterwards then it is likely the port numbers need to be 
updated within the code or the connections on the raspi are loose.
